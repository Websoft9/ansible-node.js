##### NPM
The [JavaScript node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/), typically abbreviated in all lowercase as npm, is the default method for managing packages in the Node.js runtime environment. It relies upon a command line client and a database made up of public and premium packages known as the the npm registry. Users can access the registry via the client and browse the many packages available through the npm website. Both npm and its registry are managed by npm, Inc.

##### Express

##### Data disk
A disk that contains only data. It does not include an operating system.

##### Domain Name
A domain name is a server or network system name that identifies IP resources connected to the Internet. All domain names are unique worldwide.<br />

##### Image
An image is a running environment template for Cloud Server instances. It generally includes an operating system and pre-installed software. An image works as a file copy that includes data from one or more disks. These disks can be a single system disk, or a combination of the system disk and data disks.<br />

##### Marketplace Image
A marketplace image contains an OS, the preset application environment, and software. You can use marketplace images to create Cloud Server for website building and application development.<br />

##### Port
A port is an endpoint of communication in computer networking. This can be hardware port, a logical port, or both. TCP and UDP ports are identified by their port number (an integer from 0 to 65535).

##### Secure Shell (SSH)

##### Secure Shell key pair (SSH key pair)
An authentication method available for logging in to Cloud Server instances remotely. An SSH key pair is a pair of keys generated through an encryption algorithm: one key is publically available (the public key) and the other key is kept confidential (the private key).

If you have placed the public key in a Linux instance, you can use the private key to log on to the instance using SSH commands or related tools from a local computer or another instance without a password.

##### SFTP
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol. It runs over the SSH protocol . It supports the full security and authentication functionality of SSH.<br />

##### Security Group
A security group implements access controls for Cloud Server, specifying the communication scope of Cloud Server. You can define different access control rules for a security group, and these rules take effect for all Cloud Server added to this security group. By default, a security group allows all data packets that are sent out from Cloud Server in it, and Cloud Server in the same security group can access each other.
