# Using NPM

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the tool used by over 11,000,000 JavaScript developers around the world. Your developers already use it. Your company depends on it. Create an Org and get more out of the tools your team already knows and loves.

NPM consists of three distinct components:

- the website
- the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- the registry

Use the [website](https://npmjs.com/) to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up [Orgs](https://www.npmjs.com/features) (organizations) to manage access to public or private packages.

The [CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

The [registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it
